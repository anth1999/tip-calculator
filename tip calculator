#what was the total bill ?
#How much tip would you like to give ?10,20 or 30 ?

print("welcome to the tip calculator")
bill = int(input("what was the total bill ?"))
tip = int(input("How much tip would you like to give ?"))
people = int(input("How many people to split the bill ?"))
tip_as_percent = tip / 100
total_tip_amount = bill * tip_as_percent
total_bill = bill + total_tip_amount
bill_per_person = total_bill / people
final_amount = "{:.2f}".format(bill_per_person)
print(f"Each person should pay : $ {final_amount}")
